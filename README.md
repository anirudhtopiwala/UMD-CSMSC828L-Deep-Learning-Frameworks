# Implementing different neural networks on established Datsets.

Here I have experimented with various established datasets and carried out my own implementation of networks and have reported the accuracies.

1) **CIFAR 10** : Using my own implementation of VGG13, I was able to get an test accuracy of 88.55 % and a test loss of 0.4972. (PyTorch)(Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/UMD-CSMSC828L-Problem-Set-Solutions/tree/master/CIFAR10))

2) **Flower** :  Using the [flower dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/), I was able to  get test accuracy of 81.81 % and a test loss of 0.777. (PyTorch)(Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/UMD-CSMSC828L-Problem-Set-Solutions/tree/master/PS3))

3) **Fashion MNIST** : I was able to get a test accuracy of 91.64 % and loss of 0.27. (keras)(Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/UMD-CSMSC828L-Problem-Set-Solutions/blob/master/PS2/PS2%20-%20Fashion%20MNIST-%20Anirudh%20Topiwala.ipynb))

4) **MNIST** : I was able to get a test accuracy of 99.06 % and loss of 0.0440. (keras)(Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/UMD-CSMSC828L-Problem-Set-Solutions/blob/master/PS2/PS2%20-%20MNIST%20.ipynb))
